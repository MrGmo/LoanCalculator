# LoanCalculator

Hi there!

This repo contains a simple loan calculator. The calculator takes three inputs: amount borrowed, interest rate, and years to repay. Using this information it will yield your monthly payment, toal amount to be re-paid, and total interest paid on the loan.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

This was one of my first projects, but I'm just now getting around to writing a read-me file for it. This project taught be alot about nesting HTML elements and the process of using frameworks. It was my introduction to Boostrap and some of it's basic features. Most of the site is built with HTML and vanilla JS, with just a bit of Boostrap styling. The entire build of this project was pretty straight forward, the only real challenge was using the setTimeOut function properly on the JS portion of it. After a little bit of research I figured it out though. :)

Possible Improvements:

If I had more time I would have given this calculator some responsive CSS to make it more mobile friendly.

Lessons Learned:

1. Nesting HTML elements and layering of classes/Id's is very important to any project
2. Creating elements with JS and understaind the setTimeOut function


Here's a couple more projects I've built:
